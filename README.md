# A-self-made-tutorial-for-GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-GFM-and-its-source-codes
This is a paper version of A-self-made-tutorial-for-GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-GFM.

(From the abstract the paper)

This is a short self-explanatory tutorial for GFM. GitHub provides users with a syntax for formatting text called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). Everyone who uses GitHub needs simple knowledges of GFM. GitHub is a good platform to exchange program sources. The filename extension for GFM is md, used as (filename).md. The content of the tutorial is the same as that of my file "A-self-made-tutorial-for-GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-GFM.md" ,which was written in 2016 as a service for the users of GFM. The file was revised in 2023. This short tutotial gives a set of concrete descriptions and their sources written by using GFM. Although there is little explanation and one will directly understand the contents from the sources with ease. And one will be able to write sentences to be used in GitHub soon, if one minics the sources. We shall give README.md and all the source codes of the 
tutorial file in the Appendices.
